## React app Dockerized

It is a simple react app. I created this project with the command:

  $npx create-react-app react-docker
  
After, I create a Dockerfile to specify instructions needed to create the corresponding image.

You can have the image by writing this command :
   
   $docker pull nourchen/react-docker:1
